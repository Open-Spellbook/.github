## Welcome to the Open Spellbook Org page! 
This project is a mission-driven effort to resurrect and return the Spellbook DBT project, previously overseen by Dune Analytics, back to its rightful place within the open-source community under the MIT license.

In this organization, you will find repositories dedicated to various SQL/cloud provider versions, as well as the core web repository.

## 🚀 Impact,

By bringing the Spellbook back to open source, we aim to:

- 📖 Enrich the open-source repository with an up-to-date Spellbook.
- 📊 Amplify blockchain data processing efficiency within the Web3 community.
- 👩‍💻 Foster collaboration amongst developers, data scientists, and Blockchain projects.
- 📈 Set a benchmark for data transformation techniques in Web3.
