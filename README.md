# Open Spellbook

Welcome to the Open Spellbook Org page! This project is a mission-driven effort to resurrect and return the Spellbook DBT project, previously overseen by Dune Analytics, back to its rightful place within the open-source community under the MIT license.

In this organization, you will find repositories dedicated to various SQL/cloud provider versions, as well as the core web repository.

### Gitcoin Grants Round 18

This project is currently participating in Gitcoin Grants Round 18. Every contribution, big or small, can make a significant impact due to quadratic matching.

ðŸŒŸ **[Donate to Open Spellbook on Gitcoin](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/0x8de918f0163b2021839a8d84954dd7e8e151326d/0x8de918f0163b2021839a8d84954dd7e8e151326d-102)** ðŸŒŸ

## Background

The Spellbook was originally created by Dune Analytics and is the fruit of collective wisdom gathered from numerous Web3 data enthusiasts. Its main purpose was to serve as an abstraction layer, converting raw blockchain data into meaningful insights. However, in June, Dune decided to steer away from the open-source route of the Spellbook in two significant ways:

1. Transition from SPARKQL to a closed-source SQL engine named DUNESQL.
2. Introduction of a restrictive license on the Spellbook.

Our project is a response to the above changes. We have taken the last MIT-licensed version of the Spellbook and forked it. Our goals are simple:

- **Revive Open Source**: Return the Spellbook back to open source.
- **Retroactive Funding**: Recognize and compensate those who've been instrumental in building the Spellbook.
- **Future Vision**: Raise a pool of funds to continue and maintain the OS Spellbook.

## Funding & Budget

We've embarked on a mission to raise funds for the project, and our approach to using these funds is transparent and community-centric:

- **If <20k is received**: All of the grant will be allocated for retroactive funding. This is because a lesser interest suggests we might not have the resources to set up a future-focused DAO.
- **If >20k is received**: We'd use 50% for retroactive funding and the rest for future contributions.

Contributors to the project have a window of one month to prove their contributions, after which they can:

1. Claim their rewards.
2. Forfeit their claim, essentially directing their share towards future endeavors.

We are also discussing the best way to distribute rewards, with the current leaning towards considering GitHub commits as a standard. 

Assuming we raise more than 20k for future contributions, half of the grant funds will be locked in a Multi-Sig Safe. We're contemplating rewarding contributors based on quadratic voting with Gitcoin Grant Stack's support.

## Impact

By bringing the Spellbook back to open source, we aim to:

- Enrich the open-source repository with an up-to-date Spellbook.
- Amplify blockchain data processing efficiency within the Web3 community.
- Foster collaboration amongst developers, data scientists, and Blockchain projects.
- Set a benchmark for data transformation techniques in Web3.
